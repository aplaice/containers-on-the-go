This repository contains the "rescued" open source code for Containers On The Go. The addon was originally present at:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/containers-on-the-go/

The last version (1.14?) of "Containers On The Go" was regrettably made non-free. Reportedly, according to some of the reviews from the time, the code was also obfuscated (I personally did not look at the code of the non-free version). Even more regrettably, the add-on was recently (mid-2019) removed from the AMO altogether, though I'm not sure about the reason.

This branch contains the history of the addon, based on the files extracted from the XPIs that I had archived at the time, with commits simulating the release history. (It does not include the very last, non-free release, firstly because I hadn't actually archived that, and secondly because posting it on github would be a copyright violation.)

The license from versions 1.1 to 1.10 was MPL-2.0 (based on memory and partially supported by the [Web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20170901095125/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/containers-on-the-go/)).

The license for versions 1.11 and 1.13 (the latest code present in this repository) was GPL-3.0 (fully corroborated by the [Web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20170917103402/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/containers-on-the-go/versions/)).

You can also see the original XPIs at the `xpis` branch, in this repository.

About this Add-on
This add-on allows you to quickly log into several online accounts at the same time from the same Firefox browser. Also your privacy is enhanced when browsing in different containers because websites like Google will see you as different users.

The add-on will instantly create new containers for the new tabs. The containers are automatically removed when the tabs are closed.

- The add-on requires the Container Tabs to be enabled in Firefox. The Container Tabs can be enabled from Options -> Privacy -> Container Tabs.
- The tabs can be opened by clicking on the toolbar button or using the Alt+C shortcut.
- You can open a link in a new tab-container by right-clicking on it and choosing the "Open link in a new container"
- The right-click menu choice can be disabled from the Add-on Options page

The add-on will substitute the functionality of the now defunct Multifox add-on.
